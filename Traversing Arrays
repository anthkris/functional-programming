Traversing Arrays
We would normally use a for loop to iterate through each item in an array. However, when specifying order in which things are presented is not important, you can use forEach to abstract this step.

Exercise 1: Print All the Names in an Array

var names = ["Ben", "Jafar", "Matt", "Priya", "Brian"],
		counter;

	for(counter = 0; counter < names.length; counter++) {
		console.log(names[counter]);
	}
	
Exercise 2: Use ForEach to print all the names in an array
var names = ["Ben", "Jafar", "Matt", "Priya", "Brian"];

	names.forEach(function(name) {
		console.log(name);
	});
